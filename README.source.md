# Meet ReverseMarkdown

[![Windows Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xse0bia9olr5shxr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BabuAnnamalai/reversemarkdown-net) [![Windows Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/mysticmind/reversemarkdown-net.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mysticmind/reversemarkdown-net) [![NuGet Version](https://badgen.net/nuget/v/reversemarkdown)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReverseMarkdown/)

ReverseMarkdown is a Html to Markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) converter library in C#. Conversion is very reliable since HtmlAgilityPack (HAP) library is used for traversing the Html DOM.

Note that the library implementation is based on the Ruby based Html to Markdown converter [ xijo/reverse_markdown](https://github.com/xijo/reverse_markdown).

## Usage

You can install the package from NuGet using `Install-Package ReverseMarkdown` or clone the repository and built it yourself.

## Configuration options

* `GithubFlavored` - Github style markdown for br, pre and table. Default is false
* `RemoveComments` - Remove comment tags with text. Default is false
* `SmartHrefHandling` - how to handle `<a>` tag href attribute
  * `false` - Outputs `[{name}]({href}{title})` even if name and href is identical. This is the default option.
  * `true` - If name and href equals, outputs just the `name`. Note that if Uri is not well formed as per [`Uri.IsWellFormedUriString`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.uri.iswellformeduristring) (i.e string is not correctly escaped like `http://example.com/path/file name.docx`) then markdown syntax will be used anyway.
               
    If `href` contains `http/https` protocol, and `name` doesn't but otherwise are the same, output `href` only
    
    If `tel:` or `mailto:` scheme, but afterwards identical with name, output `name` only.
* `UnknownTags` - handle unknown tags. 
  * `UnknownTagsOption.PassThrough` - Include the unknown tag completely into the result. That is, the tag along with the text will be left in output. This is the default
  * `UnknownTagsOption.Drop` - Drop the unknown tag and its content
  * `UnknownTagsOption.Bypass` - Ignore the unknown tag but try to convert its content
  * `UnknownTagsOption.Raise` - Raise an error to let you know
* `WhitelistUriSchemes` - Specify which schemes (without trailing colon) are to be allowed for `<a>` and `<img>` tags. Others will be bypassed (output text or nothing). By default allows everything.

  If `string.Empty` provided and when `href` or `src` schema coudn't be determined - whitelists
  
  Schema is determined by `Uri` class, with exception when url begins with `/` (file schema) and `//` (http schema)
* `TableWithoutHeaderRowHandling` - handle table without header rows
  * `TableWithoutHeaderRowHandlingOption.Default` - First row will be used as header row (default)
  * `TableWithoutHeaderRowHandlingOption.EmptyRow` - An empty row will be added as the header row

> Note that UnknownTags config has been changed to an enumeration in v2.0.0 (breaking change)

## Features

* Supports all the established html tags like h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, em, strong, i, b, blockquote, code, img, a, hr, li, ol, ul, table, tr, th, td, br
* Can deal with nested lists
* Github Flavoured Markdown conversion supported for br, pre and table. Use `var config = new ReverseMarkdown.Config(githubFlavoured:true);`. By default table will always be converted to Github flavored markdown immaterial of this flag.
